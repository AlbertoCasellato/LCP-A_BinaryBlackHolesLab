    "- **Stable Mass Transfer (SMT)**\n",
    "- **Common Envelope (CE)**\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to analyze how different initial conditions influence the final properties of binary black holes.\n",
    "-->\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Goal of the Project\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of the project is to understand the differences between binary black hole (BBH) mergers whose progenitor stars evolved via common envelope (CE) and those whose progenitors evolved via stable mass transfer (SMT). We analyze a set of simulated binary black holes, focusing on how the different evolutionary paths affect the final properties of the binary black holes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is to split the analysis into two parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Classify BBH mergers based on their evolutionary path.**  \n",
    "  The dataset contains information about whether a BBH system evolved via common envelope (CE) or stable mass transfer (MT). This is recorded in **Column 21** of the dataset:  \n",
    "  - `True`: The system underwent a common envelope phase.  \n",
    "  - `False`: The system evolved via stable mass transfer.  \n",
    "  We will analyze the key features that distinguish these two types of BBH systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Analyzing the impact of different physical parameters on the formation of BBHs.**  \n",
    "  The dataset includes simulations with different values of the **alpha parameter** (α = 0.5, 1, 3, 5), which determines the efficiency of the common envelope process. We will investigate how α affects the properties of BBH mergers.\n",
    "\n",
    "To perform this analysis, we will use visualization techniques and machine learning methods (e.g., Random Forest) to determine the most significant features influencing BBH evolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Theoretical Background\n",
    "\n",
    "A **binary star system** is composed of two stars that orbit around the center of mass of the system. The most massive star is called the **primary star** (or *donor star*), and the other one is the **secondary star** (or *accretor*). There are different ways in which a star can lose mass:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Stellar winds** due to the natural evolution.\n",
    "- **Roche Lobe overflow**: when a star increases in size due to natural evolution, exceeding a certain boundary. This boundary is defined by two teardrop-shaped equipotential surfaces that connect the two stars, within which the stars are confined. Each teardrop is called the **Roche Lobe** of a star, and the point where they touch is the **Lagrangian point L1**. When stellar matter reaches L1, it is no longer gravitationally bound to the donor star and is transferred to the accretor, initiating a process of mass transfer known as **Roche Lobe overflow**.\n",
    "\n",
    "From literature, we know that $R_L \\propto a \\ f(q)$, where:\n",
    "- $R_L$ is the Roche Lobe radius,\n",
    "- $a$ is the semi-major axis of the system,\n",
    "- $q$ is the mass ratio of the two stars.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/roche_potential_1.png\" width=\"400\">\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two types of responses a star can have to mass loss, depending on its internal structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Stable Mass Transfer (SMT)**: The star responds to mass loss by adjusting its size, leading to a gradual transfer of mass to the secondary star. This results in minimal mass loss from the system.\n",
    "- **Common Envelope (CE)**: The primary star expands uncontrollably, leading to an unstable phase where the outer layers engulf both stars, forming a common envelope.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 Common Envelope\n",
    "The common envelope that surrounds the two stars extends beyond the system's orbit. Due to angular momentum conservation, it rotates slower than the two stars inside. This difference in velocity creates friction forces, which extract energy from the system, causing the two stars to spiral inward.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two possible outcomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The system transfers enough energy to the common envelope to eject it outward, leaving behind a shrunken orbit and significant mass loss.\n",
    "- The system fails to transfer enough energy, leading to the merger of both stars inside the envelope, forming a single object surrounded by the ejected material.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **$\\alpha$ parameter** is a free parameter that quantifies the efficiency of energy transfer between the system and the common envelope. It determines how much orbital energy is used to eject the envelope. The larger $\\alpha$, the more efficient the energy transfer needs to be for the system to survive as a binary.\n",
    "\n",
    "<!--A higher \\(\\alpha_{\\text{CE}}\\) generally leads to more efficient envelope ejection, less orbital shrinkage, and a higher likelihood of the binary system surviving the CE phase. However, the exact value of \\(\\alpha_{\\text{CE}}\\) is highly uncertain and can vary depending on the specific system and the physics of the CE process.-->\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/common_envelope_evolution.png\" width=\"400\">\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<!--\n",
    "Da aggiungere alle conclusioni:\n",
    "- CE processo più dissipativo, infatti crea buchi neri di massa più piccola, mentre SMT crea BH più massicci\n",

    "To analyze the impact of different parameters on the evolution of binary systems, we compare the distribution of key properties across various values of α, considering different metallicities and evolutionary pathways (Stable Mass Transfer, SMT, and Common Envelope, CE).  \n",

    "Each figure consists of two rows:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- The first row represents systems that evolve through **Stable Mass Transfer (SMT)**.  \n",
    "- The second row corresponds to systems undergoing **Common Envelope (CE) evolution**.  \n",
    "- Each column illustrates a different value of the **α parameter**, which governs the efficiency of energy transfer during CE evolution.  \n",

    "The histograms within each plot show the distribution of a specific property for different **metallicities**. Lower metallicities are represented by **darker colors**, while higher metallicities appear in **lighter shades**. High metallicity (Z) is only observed in common envelope (CE) systems with a decreasing trend as alpha increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the α parameter only affects **CE evolution**, the first row (SMT) is expected to remain consistent across different α values. This consistency allows for a direct comparison with the second row (CE), where variations due to α can be observed. \n",

As alpha increases, there is a reduction in the number of primary stars with higher mass formed through common envelope (CE). When $\\alpha \\ge 3$,  systems with a high primary star mass that evolve through stable mass transfer (SMT) become more prevalent than those that undergo CE.\n",

The mass ratio tends to invert once a binary black hole (BBH) system is formed, with the ratio sometimes reaching values greater than or equal to 1, especially for alpha ≥ 3. In low-metallicity common envelope (CE) systems, the ratio remains between 0 and 1. For stable mass transfer (SMT), the mass ratio stays small, which implies a minimal change in the mass ratio of the system. In contrast, CE systems experience significant mass loss, leading to an inversion of the ratio (M2 > M1).\n",

    "Another method we use to compare the two classes is the visualization of the fraction of systems that evolved through SMT and CE as function of metallicity. There will be a plot for each value of alpha and the fraction of systems is normalized. In yellow are represented the systems that underwent CE and in green the ones that formed through SMT. \n",
