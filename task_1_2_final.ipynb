    "# Binary Black Hole Evolution: Stable Mass Transfer vs Common Envelope\n",

    "## 1. Goal of the Project\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of our project is, given a set of simulated binary black hole (BBH) systems, to understand how the physical properties of the systems are correlated with their evolutionary path (Stable Mass Transfer or Common Envelope). \n",
    "\n",
    "Our task is divided into two parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Classify the BBHs based on their evolutionary track \n",
    "- Analyze how different physical parameters affect the evolution of BBH mergers\n",
    "\n",
    "To perform this, we will use visualization techniques and machine learning methods (e.g., Random Forest) to determine the most significant features that influence BBH mergers evolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Theoretical Background\n",
    "\n",
    "A **binary star system** is composed of two stars that orbit around the center of mass of the system. The most massive star is called the **primary star** (or *donor star*), and the other one is the **secondary star** (or *accretor*). There are different ways in which a star can lose mass; the most common are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Stellar winds**: which occours because of single star evolution. This mass loss follows the relation $\\dot{M} \\propto Z^p$, with $p$ a coefficient that depends on the star's temperature.\n",
    "- **Roche Lobe overflow**: which happens when a star increases in size due to natural evolution, exceeding a certain boundary. This boundary is defined by two teardrop-shaped equipotential surfaces that connect the two stars, within which the stars are confined. Each teardrop is called the **Roche Lobe** of a star, and the point where they meet is the **Lagrangian point L1**. When stellar matter reaches L1, it is no longer gravitationally bound to the donor star and is transferred to the accretor, starting a process of mass transfer known as **Roche Lobe overflow**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 Roche Lobe Overflow\n",
    "The donor star has the biggest Roche lobe, but it is the first one to fill it because the more a star is massive and the faster is its evolution.\\\n",
    "From the literature, we get that $R_L \\propto a \\ f(q)$, where:\n",
    "- $R_L$ is the Roche Lobe radius,\n",
    "- $a$ is the semi-major axis of the system,\n",
    "- $q$ is the mass ratio of the two stars.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/roche_potential.png\" width=\"400\">\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two types of responses a star can have to mass loss, depending on its internal structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Stable Mass Transfer (SMT)**: The star responds to mass loss by adjusting its size, leading to a gradual transfer of mass to the secondary star. This results in minimal mass loss from the system.\n",
    "- **Common Envelope (CE)**: The primary star expands uncontrollably, leading to an unstable phase where the outer layers engulf both stars, forming a common envelope.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 Common Envelope\n",
    "The common envelope that surrounds the two stars extends beyond the system's orbit. Due to angular momentum conservation, it rotates slower than the two stars inside. This difference in velocity creates friction forces, which extract energy from the system, causing the two stars to spiral inward.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two possible outcomes:\n",
    "- The system transfers enough energy to the common envelope to eject it outward, leaving behind a shrunken orbit and a significant mass loss.\n",
    "- The system fails to transfer enough energy, leading to the merging of both stars inside the envelope, forming a single object surrounded by the ejected material.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **$\\alpha$ parameter** is a free parameter that quantifies the efficiency of energy transfer between the system and the common envelope. It determines how much orbital energy is used to eject the envelope: the larger it is, the lesser orbital energy is required.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/common_envelope_evolution.png\" width=\"400\">\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<!--\n",
    "Da aggiungere alle conclusioni:\n",
    "- CE processo più dissipativo, infatti crea buchi neri di massa più piccola, mentre SMT crea BH più massicci\n",
    "-->\n",
    "\n",

    "## 3. Datasets\n",
    "\n",
