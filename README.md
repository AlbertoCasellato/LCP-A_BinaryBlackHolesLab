# Binary Black Holes Lab

## Project Overview
This repository contains the project developed for the **Laboratory of Computational Physics (LCP)** course. The focus is on studying the **formation and evolution of binary black holes** through the analysis of simulated data. 

Binary black holes can form via different evolutionary pathways, such as **common envelope (CE)** or **stable mass transfer (MT)**. This project aims to understand the differences between these pathways by analyzing simulated datasets and exploring key features that influence binary black hole evolution.
